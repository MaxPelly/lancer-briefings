In order to avoid the anti orbital weaponary the Lancers made a rapid insertion via orbital drop pods yet still took heavy fire resulting in the group being split.
Unfortunately, they also landed right in the middle of a patrol, resulting in a desperate fire fight while they attempted to regroup. Contact has not been made since...
