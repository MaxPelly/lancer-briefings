In order to avoid the anti orbital weaponary the Lancers made a rapid insertion via orbital drop pods yet still took heavy fire resulting in the group being split.
Unfortunately, they also landed right in the middle of a patrol, resulting in a desperate fire fight while they attempted to regroup. Contact has not been made since...

Having dealt with the patrol the lancers reestablish contact and are ordered to move on the orbital weapons platform. Lancer **Charon** is unable to continue with the mission due to suffering significant damage and will be evacuated once the platform is neutralised.

Coordinating with a diversionary strike the lancers move on the orbital platform, rapidly subduing the few remaining defenders and claiming the site. A few barony troops break from the diversion to attempt to reclaim the system however are prevented from approaching by **Birdy** until the site can be reinforced. The full *Thorian Mineral Extraction* contingent is able to make planetfall and a large group spearheaded by the lancers moves **Anchortown**.
