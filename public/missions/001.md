## A Little Bit Damp

[Distress Beacon Ven-12-09-N/A RECEIVED]
[Vessel : “The Venture”]
[Class : Research]
[Last mission objective : [REDACTED]]
[Last Location: *ERROR*]

The research vessel, “The Venture”, emitted a distress beacon shortly after entering the orbit of an unnamed, undocumented planet. In the final moments before losing communication, The Venture had detected a massive energy surge emanating from the planet’s surface. The planet is believed to be uninhabited and assumed to have a hostile atmosphere. From the crash data, it is unlikely that there are any survivors. However, the source of the energy surge has spiked some interest. Your mission is to investigate the site of the surge, gather as much intel as you can and get out. Simple, right?
