# Mission // #001
## Signals Left Unsung

Running short of resources, and perhaps running short of caution, the World's End is on the prowl for any source of fab-mats they can find. A long abandoned asteroid mining hub, later turned research centre, has a distress signal dated over a decade ago. 

Find the source.

Eliminate any threat.

Secure the resources.

Survive.
