# Mission // #003
## Operation Howling Blade

A mineral rights dispute on Himalaya-067 has descended into armed conflict between Thorian Mineral Extraction and the Dukedom of House Varrin. Both of their operational borders have been nearing each other for a while, though armed conflict seemed a distant proposition until recently. Initial offensive operations by TME have ground to a halt and they are now looking for outside support. 
Your team is tasked with descending planetside and breaking the siege of Anchortown by any means necessary. These aren’t the usual pirate fare you have had to contend with; be prepared to face highly trained houseguards and strong discipline.
This is an extended deployment, requiring travel to the system edge and at least a week on planet, if not longer. Higher-ups are going to be watching, so make sure to keep things professional down there. 
# Goals
- Break the siege (500 manna)
- Destroyof high priority target Alpha – **Sir Leon**, bastard son of Duke Varrin and the acting field commander (500 manna)
