# Mission // #004
## Exploring Astran IV

You’ve taken up a small side contract escorting a supply run to Astran IV with Captain Holmes, a relatively new officer on the World’s End. The planet has come under pirate attacks and a heavily armoured freighter is delivering emergency aid. As you’re about to arrive at a frontier town, you stop to see a group of Lancers. 
Their previous mission was abruptly ended when their shuttle was shot down. Captain Holmes gives you new orders: continue investigating the planet’s surface for evidence of pirate activity. The freighter will be back in one week to bring further supplies, so you’ll be on your own for that time.
