## Budding Problems

Rats abound, and MirrorSmoke has been pawing forth with apprehension and anticipation both. This isn't the first enquiry, not by far, but it is the first open swipe.

Due to the actions of one operative under the corporations employ there is concerns that foreign agents may have compromised their interests and while they are on the whole reticent with details a picture begins to unfold, especially for those already involved.

A previous patrol has noted suspicious activity on the husk-world of Apen-B, including delusion comments about shifting cabins alongside suspicious mega-fauna infesting a high priority source of energised fluid deposits and a potentially sabotaged maintenance centre, tracing the activities of the LLC responsible for the husk-world lead to a series of convergent deliveries towards the nature reserve and resort hub "Alaren".

Your job is to make planetfall, find the destination of these deliveries and if at all possible retrieve them, it should however be noted that the local polity will not tolerate any damage to their carefully cultivate environs, so any form of "Foliage management" is to be limited, upon pain of docked pay.


# Goals
- 300 for identifying location of suspect cargo
- 200 for retrieving said cargo
- 200 for doing so without environmental damage

(Notes, MirrorSmoke is looking for fresh recruits without much experience... or liabilities... or family to sue upon death or dismemberment... for this mission! Low ll's greatly encouraged!)
