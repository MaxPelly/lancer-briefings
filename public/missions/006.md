Heyyyaaa itâ€™s Haze ðŸ™‚
Need a few Lancers to pop down to the Sim-Lab and help me with a tiny technical problem â€“ nothing major. Anyway, I have made sure to install all your current combat data, so you will have access to your full tactical arsenal. 
500 Manna for removing the problem and not telling anyone about it. 
Extra 100 Manna if at any point, all players characters are in the danger zone.
