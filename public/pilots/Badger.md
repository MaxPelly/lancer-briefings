<<< END CRIMINAL RECORD
>>> BEGIN ELIGIBILITY ASSESSMENT

Subject has seemingly had no criminal activity in over 5 years, however recognizing him as an
official Lancer pilot is, understandably, impossible, due to his many outstanding offences,
including a life imprisonment. That said, subject's talent does significantly exceed the minimum
requirements for the Union's official Lancer program. However, Union will hold no liability for any
incidences that may occur if / while the subject is in the requestor's employ.
