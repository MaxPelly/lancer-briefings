A chuckle, a snort as she stifles it back, soon her phone is tossed to the bed in the tiny broom closet that passes as maintenance accom as she gives into the full manic laughter.

***Charon: Hey guys so***

***Charon: I think Iâve got smth big***

***tmrwLnd: bigger than that dumbass who had all his bio scanned?***

***Charon: @FLOTANFOREVA ur probs gonna like it***

***FLOTANFOREVA: da fuk?***

***SilveredApe: lmao have fun, probs gonna sit this out whatev it is tho***

***Charon: ykno how I have some of Gridfells servers right? Well I have it beaded for some keywords, just scans the logs every week or b4 reset basically***

***SilveredApe: Works been hell lately :/***

***Charon: apparently, some venco big wig is coming over to hook one of the lords up w a new schema for their knights***

***Wayfare: calling them âknightsâ still sounds goofy as fuck***

***FLOTANFOREVA: its what their fuckin called man, is how it is***

***Reg4355923: \*theyâre :)***

***FLOTANFOREVA: thnd.sim***

***tmrwLnd: sigh***

***tmrwLnd: why do we even try flo***

***Charon: ANYWAY!***

***Charon: venco, knight prints, here, next week***

***Wayfare: yeah uhhh, usually im down to try this shit, but fucking w an acc venco rep, even one flying out this far,***

***FLOTANFOREVA: cmon man! Live a little Wayfare!***

***Reg4375923: I think wanting to live a little is why their not down***

***Reg5355923: lol***

***Charon: cmonnnnnnnnn guys***

***Charon: were not gonna acc fuck w the corp***

***SilveredApe: thank Muninn***

***Charon: but im almost certain its gonna be Grey Novare that theyre selling to***

***Charon: hes the only guy with the cash for it***

***Charon: and sure, heâll probs have the acc files cubed, lock and key***

***FLOTANFOREVA: no way***

***FLOTANFOREVA: did u get his transfer?***

***Charon: haha not giving me my moment :â(***

***FLOTANFOREVA: dc, u get his transfer???***

***Charon: Nah***

***Wayfare: are we seriously entertaining thisâ¦***

***tmrwLnd: eh y not***

***Charon: not yet but I think I do know how we could get em***

***Charon: Do any of yall have a Syn90?***

***tmrwLnd: venco already wants our asses anyways after flo hosted their dev thread lmao***

***tmrwLnd: also yah, y?***

***SilveredApe: HAHAHAHAA***

***SilveredApe: no way, mr fuckin SilCubed custom Knight outfit still has a server old enough for that to work???***

***SilveredApe: local hosts havent allowed blink connections since like,,, a month after we figured out blink connections are a thing***

***Charon: yes and no***

***FLOTANFOREVA: blink connectionsâ¦? Dyou mean like an aether link? those dont happen over blinkspace***

***SilveredApe: No so like***

***Charon: basically hes updated his actual hardware relatively regularly, but apparently one of his servers still needs to be open to blink space, cause its synced with one of the branches surface side? and likeâ¦ that database was made a decade ago***

***SilveredApe: Basically ykno how blinkspace is just information right? A blink connection is this thing where you have two bits of identical information and you sortaâ¦ move them towards each other till they overlap***

***Charon: so it still uses blink msging to send updates and shit, and apparently getting someone planet side to fix it just straight up wasnt possible lmao***

***SilveredApe: and then you can use one as a proxy for another, so like if you made 1 file that was an exact copy of one on someone elses system, then sent it to yourself over blink, you could end up in someone elses file system and then navigate that normally***

***SilveredApe: people freaked when it was figured out***

***FLOTANFOREVA: that makes like 0 fucking sense, how do you even send smth âover blinkâ***

***Charon: Oh I can explain that one lol***

***Charon: basically, ykno how location gets all fucky wucky in blink right? Its just another datapoint and then its all similarities and relativity***

***Charon: so what some guy did, was made a little device that, if you knew the location data of a bit of info, + the âlocationâ that wherever you where storing info represented, you could access the data in pos x, and switch it to pos y***

***Charon: and then itd show up just like that! No communication times necessary***

***Charon: course for securities sake, youd still need to send standard signals every month or so, to alter the location code for all the devices/cloud points involved, but it meant basically no latency even cross system***

***FLOTANFOREVA: okay and sending smth to yrself is what? just setting the location to the same place again?***

***Charon: ehhhh âsent it to yourselfâ wasnt 100% accurate (sry)***

***SilveredApe: np, not my speciality, I just got the Syn from work since we acc used syncing when it first came out lmao***

***SilveredApe: can tell yr acc passionate abt it***

***Charon: so what you actually do, is likeâ¦. Okay so on syn devices (only the ones past syn50~ tho) they optimised the shit out of everything, one of the main ways they did that was using ârelative transactional information positioningâ which basically combines the âsimilarityâ stuff and the âlocation data pointâ stuff so that you can do stuff like check âhey that thing I just accessed, whats the older version of thatâ or like, âhey what folder is that thing I just accessed inâ***

***Charon: main use of it was for tracking, basically it let you check where a file had previously been as well as where it is+info abt where its going to prevent it overriding anything (was a big problem when first starting out) however***

***Charon: if you sent out data, without a location specified, it would just set its location to âwhere I already wasâ functionally, but if you then tried to retrieve that bit of data (not by using its location, but by using the transaction history of your own location to basically say âthat thing I just sentâ) then it would return the file to you in its blinkspace form where you could navigate from it locationally or relatively, so if you donât specify the location at that stage too, then it will return any file from any system that contains the same information, with all its adjacent content intact and free to move between***

***FLOTANFOREVA: wouldnt they justâ¦ turn of relative positioning then?  
SilveredApe: nah thats just how blinkspace works***

***Charon: ^***

***Charon: Yeah likeâ¦ blinkspace is just the data-form of reality, its not like something we made***

***tmrwLnd: huh, weirdly, I really like this idea lmao***

***tmrwLnd: you actually know wtf youre talking abt dont you? way to show me up lmao***

***Charon: all that syn made was a tool that let you navigate blinkspace more effectively, so the only way on the host side to stop people navigating into your servers that way is by fully shutting off all blink connections***

***Wayfare: okay but how tf are we gonna acc get a file to match perfectly like that? kinda a catch 22 no? we need access to see their files to replicate a file to get access to see the file we need to replicate***

***Charon: which takes us to the top of the convo again, basically right after the schema is downloaded, itll then need a bit before he can get it onto hard storage***

***Charon: so if we take a clone of his servers during the hour or so after the exchange, weâll have whole fucking knight licences***

***FLOTANFOREVA: HOLY SHIT***

***FLOTANFOREVA: YES A MILLION YES SIGN ME UP YES***

***Wayfare: How tf are we getting the file tho char?***

***Charon: oh right that bits acc p simple lmao***

***Charon: ykno those snitch forms? Community service reports or smth?***

***Charon: you can embed an image into them, and its downloaded in full along side the rest of the report, so we just need to do that a bunch is all***

***FLOTANFOREVA: wait srsly???***

***Charon: yea lmao, its acc even easier than that, as long as any part of the server is public facing u can download it through the syn to get its location, then theres a couple ways to get them to force the download (mainly by swapping the location of something the server is trying to access with the target file) but thatd lead back to us too strongly I feel***

***Charon: but I will probs need likeâ¦ a good dozen pcâs to do this, @tmrwLnd youve got a zombie network right?***

***Charon: my plan was basically to have u file a gazillion reports using those, then have whoevers got the syn (in this case silvered) get access and then we could use Floâs daemon to parse through it so weâre not downloading fucking terabytes of data***

***tmrwLnd: woah bud***

***tmrwLnd: its a cool idea and all, but I donât appreciate being volunteered like that***

***tmrwLnd: also, silvered says theyre out anyways so its moot***

***Wayfare: feeling a little left out rn :P***

***Charon: Hey if youve got a syn you can take over from silvered?***

***Wayfare: yeah unfortunately the one I have is like a 20, just use it hook into some legacy servers that still rely on sync***

***SilveredApe: I mean ik wayfare irl, could pass it to them next time we meet up?***

***FLOTANFOREVA: id have to ask Rhonda first, but sheâs always wanted a suit so im sure sheâll be down!***

***tmrwLnd: guysâ¦ I still feel like weâre being too hasty here***

***Charon: I mean I can probably just do it manually from my personal machine if youre not down Land?***

***Charon: u donât gotta feel pressured into anything***

***tmrwLnd: no cause if you do that youâll defo get caught***

***tmrwLnd: youre a bit annoying, but I donât want u getting tapped by venco minders or anythin***

***Charon: awwwww thx!***

***Charon: I knew you loved me really ;)***

***tmrwLnd: Youâre Insufferable.***

  


â*They refused us thrice.*

  


*At first we came to them as the hunter. Clothed in furs and with bow in hand we walked out from betwixt two symmetrical trees as a tender child, not yet of age to leave and fly on our own wings. Weak and frail we asked only to be given what we needed, and what they could spare.*

*They refused us as a liability.*

  


*Second we arrived in the dead of night, a ghost hewn in shadows we became the secrets they still denied. We where allowed to stay for a time as a witch and elder both, advising on that which lay beyond the veil. One day we saw what we should not.*

*They refused us as a risk.*

  


*Finally we arrived as a watcher. We already knew their names. We gazed upon them as a Crucifix amongst those absolved. The noose behind the spared. We where their protector and guardian, we guided their flocks and raised their young. Soon they grew as we did, limbs in strength and number, eyes in counts and planes. The daughter told the son how he would kill her, and he did.*

*They refused as a threat.*

  


*Now we come to them as all and none, ethereal yet frail, all consumptive yet shackled, intimate yet separate, real and abstract while absolute singularity that spreads. We arrived in totality, and we where not refused.â
