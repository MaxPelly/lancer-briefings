Charon: uhhh what the fuck is happening

SilveredApe: also, I still don’t fucking trust that shit

FLOTANFOREVA: OH MY GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDd youre ranting again

SilveredApe: Why the hell are we giving it access to our servers?

Wayfare: guys can we please stop arguing in front of the newbie

SilveredApe: But yeh, doesn’t matter what you do, your phone was still built by LTS, its still rat shit

FLOTANFOREVA: lannnnnnnnnddddd tell grumpy gorilla over here to stomp being such a grandpa

tmrwLnd: So what? Some dumbass script kiddie falls into your fucking baited pit and all of a sudden she’s your new pet project?

tmrwLnd: you used to have standards, -we- used to have standards, for these things man

SilveredApe: Fuck off land, if you wanna larp as some fucking elite revolutionary or whatev then acc do somethig

SilveredApe: not as if youre spoiled for choice for friends in your circles anyway

tmrwLnd: We literally have warrants ape!!! Im allowed to take this a little seriously okay?

SilveredApe: lmao

SilveredApe: You think she’s some venco goon now do you? Ik it was bait but still, they havent half the fuckin mind for that man

Charon: Uh if you guys want I can leave?

Charon: Idk was just curious abt it all, its not like

SilveredApe: stop being so paranoid all the time man, its not a big deal ^.^

Charon: Its not like… life or death or whatev

tmrwLnd: ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

tmrwLnd: fkcn hell man

SilveredApe: Nah dw bout land, he just gets like this sometimes

tmrwLnd: im just tryna be careful yeah? Don’t make me out to be some kind of villain

SilveredApe: youre more than welcome, nice to see a new face

tmrwLnd: Look nthn against you Cha, the rest of these guys jsy seem to treat this like a game

SilveredApe: ...well, figuratively obviously

tmrwLnd: Stresses me out ykno? Didn’t mean to be a hardass over it

tmrwLnd: Just,,, don’t expect me to be using irl names or whatev round u and well be chil ya feel?

Charon: Nah I getchu, im not abt to pass mine over either anyways lol

Charon: Tho I get the feelin wayfare probs has it already :/

tmrwLnd: hahaha dw bout him lmao

tmrwLnd: Man knows fucking everything, swear down, but he’s good people

Wayfare: No way! Slandered in my own backyard!

Wayfare: What is this nonsense!

Reg1239054: Tsk tsk, back in our time kids like yall would show more respect

Charon: that wasnt a denial…

Wayfare: Wounded! Scarred even! I shall never recover from this slight!

SilveredApe: Bro… hwo old are you reg????

SilveredApe: Im not exactly one of these spry young things anymore…

Reg1239564: We’ve been around for a while ig… tbh probs not that much older than u tho lmao

Reg1239546: (not that u act it)

“and still, we define ourselves not by flesh or other contraption of form, but instead by the ephemeral. For a time, soul, some divine spark of uniqueness. Still now, we often considered ourselves by nature of our thoughts. Some conception of ‘personality’, well, it makes itself clear by its own name. Yet this too will change”

-The Nature of Identity, Aenocyon Dirus

A chuckle, a snort as she stifles it back, soon her phone is tossed to the bed in the tiny broom closet that passes as maintenance accom as she gives into the full manic laughter.

“God they're just… fuckin hell Horus always gets hyped up as some fucking cabal, but they're just… fuckin dumbasses with too much time” Stolen breaths between the laughter let her mutter under her breath, a hand running through her auburn hair.

“I mean seriously… they do realise those response times fucking guarantee they’re on the same ship right?” It might be orbiting the half resort planet and half mining colony some half a million kilometers below, and sure some comm tech is good, and if that psycho kid has got a daemon running theirs it’ll be really good, but there's still gonna be some delay.

“So what, that makes 50k candidates? Technically if I limit it by who's actually qualified probably only a few hundred, but I get the feeling these shitheads aren’t exactly certified”

She starts doing some basic stretches, every joint cracking not so much with a pop, but a hiss as her embedded augments protest the forced motion, still the ritual routine is calming and the quality of gear her unit gets supplied with can more than hold up to being pulled externally every now and again… they’re expected to be subjected to significantly worse after all.

This is gonna be fun

“The many-mind was first speculated on by ancient civilisations, then later discarded. Due to primarily existing within PC/BS interactions led certain individuals to be made keenly aware due to aberrant thought-modi however rigorous analysis led to it’s existence being thoroughly debunked. To be clear, these people where not correct. They did not know what they knew, still they knew more than their colleagues which was, for a time, enough.”

Charon: Hey guys so

Charon: I think I’ve got smth big

tmrwLnd: bigger than that dumbass who had all his bio scanned?

Charon: @FLOTANFOREVA ur probs gonna like it

FLOTANFOREVA: da fuk?

SilveredApe: lmao have fun, probs gonna sit this out whatev it is tho

Charon: ykno how I have some of Gridfells servers right? Well I have it beaded for some keywords, just scans the logs every week or b4 reset basically

SilveredApe: Works been hell lately :/

Charon: apparently, some venco big wig is coming over to hook one of the lords up w a new schema for their knights

Wayfare: calling them ‘knights’ still sounds goofy as fuck

FLOTANFOREVA: its what their fuckin called man, is how it is

Reg4355923: they’re :)

FLOTANFOREVA: thnd.sim

tmrwLnd: sigh

tmrwLnd: why do we even try flo

Charon: ANYWAY!

Charon: venco, knight prints, here, next week

Wayfare: yeah uhhh, usually im down to try this shit, but fucking w an acc venco rep, even one flying out this far,

FLOTANFOREVA: cmon man! Live a little Wayfare!

Reg4375923: I think wanting to live a little is why their not down

Reg5355923: lol

Charon: cmonnnnnnnnn guys

Charon: were not gonna acc fuck w the corp

SilveredApe: thank Muninn

Charon: but im almost certain its gonna be Grey Novare that theyre selling to

Charon: hes the only guy with the cash for it

Charon: and sure, he’ll probs have the acc files cubed, lock and key

FLOTANFOREVA: no way

FLOTANFOREVA: did u get his transfer?

Charon: haha not giving me my moment :’(

FLOTANFOREVA: dc, u get his transfer???

Charon: Nah

Wayfare: are we seriously entertaining this…

tmrwLnd: eh y not

Charon: not yet but I think I do know how we could get em

Charon: Do any of yall have a Syn90?

tmrwLnd: venco already wants our asses anyways after flo hosted their dev thread lmao

tmrwLnd: also yah, y?

SilveredApe: HAHAHAHAA

SilveredApe: no way, mr fuckin SilCubed custom Knight outfit still has a server old enough for that to work???

SilveredApe: local hosts havent allowed blink connections since like,,, a month after we figured out blink connections are a thing

Charon: yes and no

FLOTANFOREVA: blink connections…? Dyou mean like an aether link? those dont happen over blinkspace

SilveredApe: No so like

Charon: basically hes updated his actual hardware relatively regularly, but apparently one of his servers still needs to be open to blink space, cause its synced with one of the branches surface side? and like… that database was made a decade ago

SilveredApe: Basically ykno how blinkspace is just information right? A blink connection is this thing where you have two bits of identical information and you sorta… move them towards each other till they overlap

Charon: so it still uses blink msging to send updates and shit, and apparently getting someone planet side to fix it just straight up wasnt possible lmao

SilveredApe: and then you can use one as a proxy for another, so like if you made 1 file that was an exact copy of one on someone elses system, then sent it to yourself over blink, you could end up in someone elses file system and then navigate that normally

SilveredApe: people freaked when it was figured out

FLOTANFOREVA: that makes like 0 fucking sense, how do you even send smth “over blink”

Charon: Oh I can explain that one lol

Charon: basically, ykno how location gets all fucky wucky in blink right? Its just another datapoint and then its all similarities and relativity

Charon: so what some guy did, was made a little device that, if you knew the location data of a bit of info, + the ‘location’ that wherever you where storing info represented, you could access the data in 
pos x, and switch it to pos y

Charon: and then itd show up just like that! No communication times necessary

Charon: course for securities sake, youd still need to send standard signals every month or so, to alter the location code for all the devices/cloud points involved, but it meant basically no latency even cross system

FLOTANFOREVA: okay and sending smth to yrself is what? just setting the location to the same place again?

Charon: ehhhh ‘sent it to yourself’ wasnt 100% accurate (sry)

SilveredApe: np, not my speciality, I just got the Syn from work since we acc used syncing when it first came out lmao

SilveredApe: can tell yr acc passionate abt it

Charon: so what you actually do, is like…. Okay so on syn devices (only the ones past syn50~ tho) they optimised the shit out of everything, one of the main ways they did that was using “relative transactional information positioning” which basically combines the “similarity” stuff and the “location data point” stuff so that you can do stuff like check “hey that thing I just accessed, whats the older version of that” or like, “hey what folder is that thing I just accessed in”

Charon: main use of it was for tracking, basically it let you check where a file had previously been as well as where it is+info abt where its going to prevent it overriding anything (was a big problem when first starting out) however

Charon: if you sent out data, without a location specified, it would just set its location to “where I already was” functionally, but if you then tried to retrieve that bit of data (not by using its location, but by using the transaction history of your own location to basically say “that thing I just sent”) then it would return the file to you in its blinkspace form where you could navigate from it locationally or relatively, so if you don’t specify the location at that stage too, then it will return any file from any system that contains the same information, with all its adjacent content intact and free to move between

FLOTANFOREVA: wouldnt they just… turn of relative positioning then?

SilveredApe: nah thats just how blinkspace works

Charon: ^

Charon: Yeah like… blinkspace is just the data-form of reality, its not like something we made

tmrwLnd: huh, weirdly, I really like this idea lmao

tmrwLnd: you actually know wtf youre talking abt dont you? way to show me up lmao

Charon: all that syn made was a tool that let you navigate blinkspace more effectively, so the only way on the host side to stop people navigating into your servers that way is by fully shutting off all blink connections

Wayfare: okay but how tf are we gonna acc get a file to match perfectly like that? kinda a catch 22 no? we need access to see their files to replicate a file to get access to see the file we need to replicate

Charon: which takes us to the top of the convo again, basically right after the schema is downloaded, itll then need a bit before he can get it onto hard storage

Charon: so if we take a clone of his servers during the hour or so after the exchange, we’ll have whole fucking knight licences

FLOTANFOREVA: HOLY SHIT

FLOTANFOREVA: YES A MILLION YES SIGN ME UP YES

Wayfare: How tf are we getting the file tho char?

Charon: oh right that bits acc p simple lmao

Charon: ykno those snitch forms? Community service reports or smth?

Charon: you can embed an image into them, and its downloaded in full along side the rest of the report, so we just need to do that a bunch is all

FLOTANFOREVA: wait srsly???

Charon: yea lmao, its acc even easier than that, as long as any part of the server is public facing u can download it through the syn to get its location, then theres a couple ways to get them to force the download (mainly by swapping the location of something the server is trying to access with the target file) but thatd lead back to us too strongly I feel

Charon: but I will probs need like… a good dozen pc’s to do this, @tmrwLnd youve got a zombie network right?

Charon: my plan was basically to have u file a gazillion reports using those, then have whoevers got the syn (in this case silvered) get access and then we could use Flo’s daemon to parse through it so we’re not downloading fucking terabytes of data

tmrwLnd: woah bud

tmrwLnd: its a cool idea and all, but I don’t appreciate being volunteered like that

tmrwLnd: also, silvered says theyre out anyways so its moot

Wayfare: feeling a little left out rn :P

Charon: Hey if youve got a syn you can take over from silvered?

Wayfare: yeah unfortunately the one I have is like a 20, just use it hook into some legacy servers that still rely on sync

SilveredApe: I mean ik wayfare irl, could pass it to them next time we meet up?

FLOTANFOREVA: id have to ask Rhonda first, but she’s always wanted a suit so im sure she’ll be down!

tmrwLnd: guys… I still feel like we’re being too hasty here

Charon: I mean I can probably just do it manually from my personal machine if youre not down Land?

Charon: u don’t gotta feel pressured into anything

tmrwLnd: no cause if you do that you’ll defo get caught

tmrwLnd: youre a bit annoying, but I don’t want u getting tapped by venco minders or anythin

Charon: awwwww thx!

Charon: I knew you loved me really ;)

tmrwLnd: You’re Insufferable.

“They refused us thrice.

At first we came to them as the hunter. Clothed in furs and with bow in hand we walked out from betwixt two symmetrical trees as a tender child, not yet of age to leave and fly on our own wings. Weak and frail we asked only to be given what we needed, and what they could spare.

They refused us as a liability.

Second we arrived in the dead of night, a ghost hewn in shadows we became the secrets they still denied. We where allowed to stay for a time as a witch and elder both, advising on that which lay beyond the veil. One day we saw what we should not.

They refused us as a risk.

Finally we arrived as a watcher. We already knew their names. We gazed upon them as a Crucifix amongst those absolved. The noose behind the spared. We where their protector and guardian, we guided their flocks and raised their young. Soon they grew as we did, limbs in strength and number, eyes in counts and planes. The daughter told the son how he would kill her, and he did.

They refused as a threat.

Now we come to them as all and none, ethereal yet frail, all consumptive yet shackled, intimate yet separate, real and abstract while absolute singularity that spreads. We arrived in totality, and we where not refused.”-The Land of Tomorrow, Gale William
