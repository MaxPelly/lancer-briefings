Always on the run from his inheritance. Despite doing a weak attempt to mask his public school voice with a Northern drawl, to any moderate intelligence organisms, it is clear he's a posh boy in the middle of "a phase". A privileged childhood has provided Major with an absence of awareness of danger. This provides him with a bravery, maybe out of ignorance rather than heroism. Whilst he has run away, he knows he cannot directly say no to his mother. As such, he keeps a low profile to ensure his parents don't discover his location and make an embarrassing visit. Major is initially charming but typically takes significantly longer for him to actually open up to those he works with. Major has a complete lack of practical skills and as such, had to work up from the most basic skiff from the most suspect of employers. From this, Cresla has a particular skill in small vehicles and ships "modified" to avoid detection by the authorities.
