The following is a record of an interaction between the Lancer âHACKERMANSâ (a member of the Mirrorsmoke Company), and an unknown outside entity
====================================================================================================================================================

### This record was transcribed by Officer Haze due to the perceived significance of the recorded interaction.  This interaction took place following an extermination mission HACKERMANS was part of (for the relevant mission details, refer to mission folder 07-36-21).  During this mission, the Lancer came into with and subsequently defeated what is believed to have been a H0RUS operative.  While this encounter was streamed, any records or clips of the mission have been removed from the Lancerâs Jolt page.  This conversation took place 17 minutes after their debrief.


> <HACKERMANS> Hooh.  That wasâ¦ *quite* the stream.  Iâll have to check through the replay so I donât fall for any ofâ¦ whatever that *thing* was doing.
> 
> <HACKERMANS> At least it was profitable.  Damn did people love killing whatever that thing was.  Should probably check through those donos real quick, donât want Mirrorsmoke getting on my ass about ammo and broadband costs.  Again.
> 
> <HACKERMANS> â¦
> 
> <HACKERMANS> Donât recall letting people include files in their dono messages.
> 
> <HACKERMANS> â¦

Transcription quality drops significantly from this point forward due to a heavy increase in cybersecurity measures.


> <HACKERMANS> That outta stop anything short of prototype military malware or some really exotic stuff.
> 
> <HACKERMANS> Fuck it, we ball.  What are you little buddy?
> 
> 

The following outside transmission could not be traced, and due to there being no auditory component, no voice could be identified.  The entity sending this transmission will be referred to as âOutsiderâ.


> `<Outsider> Well well well.  So youâre the one who took down V1STA.`
> 
> <HACKERMANS> Nah nah nah, sorry buddy,  Iâm not interested in what youâre selling.  Youâre gonna have to go.
> 
> 

A burst of transmission-baffling malware was issued following the previous comment.  The transcription picks up approximately six seconds later.


> `<Outsider> So you are at least decent.  Some rather interesting polymorphics in there.  Good to know V1STA didnât die to a script kiddie.`
> 
> <HACKERMANS> What the hell is your transmission firewall made off?
> 
> <HACKERMANS> What do you want?
> 
> `<Outsider> I am here to offer a deal.  A sponsorship, to put it in your terms.`
> 
> <HACKERMANS> I have a policy of not taking money from potential cyberterrorists.
> 
> `<Outsider> Thatâs bullshit and you know it.`
> 
> <HACKERMANS> Yeah, but it sounds good right?
> 
> <HACKERMANS> ...
> 
> <HACKERMANS> What have you got?
> 
> `<Outsider> As you have killed one of our own, you have earned your place amongst us.  Presuming you can keep it, that is.`
> 
> <HACKERMANS> Youâre really not great at selling a product, yâknow that?
> 
> `<Outsider> I simply make an offer.`
> 
> <HACKERMANS> â¦can I refuse it?
> 
> `<Outsider> You can.  But you wonât.`
> 
> <HACKERMANS> How do you know that?
> 
> There is no recorded chatter for the next 23 seconds.
> 
> <HACKERMANS> Alright, what do I do?
> 
> `<Outsider> Step into your simulation chamber.`
> 
> <HACKERMANS> You know, if you wanted to kill me, you can at least face me on the battlefield in a fair fight.
> 
> `<Outsider> Whereâs the fun in that?`
> 
> `<Outsider> And trust me, if I wanted you dead, you already would be.`
> 
> <HACKERMANS> Cut the clichÃ© villain nonsense.
> 
> 

Due to changing audio quality, it can be inferred that the Lancer has entered the simulation chamber.


> <HACKERMANS> Alright, what now?
> 
> `<Outsider> Simply wait.  Oh, a few recommendations:`
> 
> <HACKERMANS> Like anything can make this less unsettling.
> 
> `<Outsider> Try to relax,`
> 
> <HACKERMANS> Bruh
> 
> `<Outsider> and keep an open mind.`
> 
> <HACKERMANS> Fuck off.
> 
> <HACKERMANS> Who are you even?  Actually, what even is
> 
> 

An increase in power draw from the Lancerâs private quarters far exceeding that expected from a personal simulation chamber being activated was recorded by Haze at this time.


> <HACKERMANS> Wh`a`t is `goi`ng o`n`
> 
> `<???> Ah, hello my new friend. Drink deep, my dear friend.  Drink deep, and descend.`

### H0RUS: Yours, if you can keep it.

The following is lancer HACKERMAN's testimony from after Operation Signals Left Unsung
======================================================================================

Why did you interface with the unidentified NHP casket?


> Seemed like a solid call. Wasn't getting any information from it any other way, and as they're sentient, the best way to figure out their deal is to talk to them.
> 
> 

>What you did was reckless in the extreme. You should have waited until the evac team arrived and extracted the casket, and let the trained Mirrorsmoke experts have dealt with it.


> Hey, when you send us on these missions, you give us free reign to deal with whatever we may encounter as we see fit, as long as it doesn't damage the brand. I dealt with the issue as I saw fit. I can't see that it damaged the brand in any serious way. Maybe things didn't perfectly, but we got you what you wanted and some extra. What's the deal?
> 
> 

>...I'm not going to dignify that with a response.

>What is your relationship with the group known as H0RUS?


> Carnal.
> 
> 

>HACKERMANS!


> That's actually a fair question. Would really like to have it down in writing somewhere. I've been thinking of it as a kinda sponsorship thing, but they haven't paid me in...ever, actually. I just get cool stuff every once in a while. It's been a bit since I got anything though. Could one of you tell that they should at least do me the service of properly ending whatever this is instead of just ghosting me?
> 
> 

>You have had no direct contact with H0RUS operatives?


> I mean, I can't hard confirm that. How do you tell who's a H0RUS operative? Not knowing is kinda their whole bit.
> 
> 

>To your knowledge, you have had no direct contact with H0RUS operatives?


> ...I don't think so, no.
> 
> 

>Why did you pause?


> Had to think on it. It can be hard to tell, y'know? Or at least so I've heard. Also memory's been a bit weird since I woke up.
> 
> 

>...and any shipments of H0RUS tech you had been receiving have recently stopped?


> "Shipment" is probably the wrong term, they just kinda showed up. But yeah. Pretty annoying honestly, I've had to go to HA to get new parts.
> 
> 

>Alright, can you explain why you made a series of shipments of precious metals between the mining colonies on [list redacted and held by Mirrorsmoke command]?


> ...what?
> 
> 

>Records show numerous transactions from your accounts with the object of obtaining and moving large quantities of precious metals.


> I never bought metals in bulk. And if I did I certainly wouldn't be sending them to some backwater mining colonies. Who told you this?
> 
> 

>HACKERMANS, if you could-


> Ecne.
> 
> 

>...Ecne. We'll have to talk about that later. But please take this seriously. Why did you make those shipments?


> I just told you, I didn't. I'm certain of it.
> 
> 

>You transaction history says otherwise.


> Someone may have hacked it. Precious metal shipment scams are a classic.
> 
> 

>You know how secure your account data is.


> You apparently got into it.
> 
> 

>This isn't going anywhere. You maintain that you made no purchase of raw metals or shipment services to transfer them?


> I did not purchase any metals, and I did not send them to some backwater mining stations.
> 
> 

>...fine. Do you have any familiarity or knowledge of the following names: Paragon, Aka, Sera, Ecne and Loki?


> Well, Sera is that NHP I found. And Ecne's me. Paragon's just a word I'm pretty sure. Don't know about the others.
> 
> 

>Are you certain?


> Of which? I'm not a hundred percent on Sera, but it sounds about right. Memory's been weird and all. As for Ecne, yeah I remember my own name. Duh. Pretty sure paragon is a word. Don't know any of the others. Why?
> 
> 

>Ok. Finally, do you have any theories on why your memory has been inconsistent following the operation?


> Well, I got hit by a rather large slab of metal travelling at high speed while mentally interfacing with an NHP, so that might have something to do with it. Combine a hard impact with a forced disconnect followed by an uncushioned fall from a decent height, and I'm probably lucky that some minor memory loss is the worst I wound up with.
> 
> 

>...sure. Now, if you could sign this.


> What is it?
> 
> 

>This is an NDA. Due to the nature of the incident, we would prefer if you don't discuss this most recent mission until we have had time to assess what exactly took place and any possible fallout.


> Let me read this.
> 
> 

>Take your time.

>>(The lancer read through the contract fully. They paid especial attention to the glossary section, reason unknown.)


> And if I don't sign?
> 
> 

>You will be barred for engaging in further contracts until the incident is resolved.


> Ok, first off, that's extortion, you know damn well I can't afford that for how long this is probably going to take. Secondly, I would prefer if this had a more definite expiration clause.
> 
> 

>We can't be taking any chances with this.


> ...alright, fine. Where's a pen?
> 
> 

>Here. That should be everything. Just stay here for a few minutes so we can assess your answers.


> Alright. Not like I was going to go anywhere. Space station and all.
> 
> 

>>This testimonial has raised concerns about the lancer in question. Recommend a high degree of surveillance of this lancer going forward.

The following addendum details pertinent events from after Operation Signals Left Unsung
========================================================================================

Lancer "HACKERMANS" has had intimate anomalous contact with the NHP known as "Sera". Following this incident, any activities undertaken by HACKERMANS that deviate from routine should be reported to Mirrorsmoke command immediately for review. This lancer is to be considered potentially under the influence of alien operatives until further notice.


> Well, both the Hydra and I made it out whole. Maybe a bit more than whole really. Head feels weird. Things sometimes feel inconsistent, it's like the edges of memories don't mesh together right. I'm going to have to look through my VODs again, see if I can cross-reference anything, find some landmark events to orient myself. Going to have to ask Ecne some things too. Does that even make sense? Talking to yourself is usually a pretty bad sign, and talking to your mech isn't much better, but then again "yourself" doesn't usually change this much.

Following the Signals Left Unsung incident, HACKERMANS has become somewhat more erratic. He (they?) has been making repeated requests for texts on NHPs, specifically ones referencing defragmentation and the nature of the NHP consciousness. This activity should be monitored closely in order to ascertain what precisely transpired between him and Sera.

Additionally, and somehow even more worryingly, HACKERMANS has been heard mentioning an entity "Ecne". All discussion surrounding this entity is confusing at least and indecipherable at worst, with pronouns and tenses seemingly being interchanged freely. It appears that the lancer himself (themself?) is unsure as to the nature and goals of this entity. Further monitoring is strongly recommended.

*A few weeks after the Signals Left Unsung incident*


> Fuck. First it's that NDA effectively confining me to barracks for Ra knows how long, then I have to deal with Mercury and Ecne, and just to add insult to injury now I have to deal with this.
> 
> 

Ecne peers at themselves in their cabin mirror. Their right eye is bloodshot.


> Probably pinkeye. No surprise since I can't leave the room without someone from command raising an alarm for "behaving abnormally". Not my fault that most of my work is from my desktop.
> 
> 

HACKERMANS sits at their terminal and pulls up a Mirrorsmoke requisition form.

Requisition form:

Sender: Ecne

Request: Seven (7) doses of eye-safe antibiotic.

Reason for request: Pinkeye

HACKERMANS looks at the form for a few seconds, then deletes it.


> Actually, given how they're being about me doing literally anything, I should probably hold that. They'd probably send me to the station med chief with a suspected case of NHP virus or something.
> 
> 

HACKERMANS goes back to the mirror. They pull their eye open in order to get a clearer look.


> ...wait a minute.
> 
> 

Ecne gingerly raises a finger, and lightly taps on their right eye.

*tink tink*


> ...
> 
> uh oh
> 
> 

HACKERMANS goes to their terminal and opens their prosocollar settings. They fiddle with the base model for a few minutes.


> That...should cover it up for the stream and anyone here.
> 
> ...
> 
> Fuck, am I on a timer?

> Welp, tick tock motherfucker, let's get to work. Any advice up there?
>

Ecne tilts their head backwards, as if to listen for something. After approximately ten seconds, they pull their head back. A single snowflake clings to their hair.


> Of course you're not helping. Ah well, was worth a shot. Let's see if Mirrorsmoke's library on NHPs has anything useful.

*A month after the Signals Left Unsung incident*

*Operation: Budding Problems*

**SPECIAL NOTICE: The Lancer HACKERMANS/Ecne is not to be notified of this operation's existence. In addition, he is not to be allowed to participate this operation under any circumstances.**


> Well that won't do.
> 
> 

Ecne sat at their desk, smiling slightly while typing away.


> I'll need to write in a script to fix that later so Mirrorsmoke can't find out in time to do anything about it. Can't believe that Haze hid this from my system. Good thing my VPN sponsor is packing a bit more signal cloaking than they let on. I'll have to shout them out during the op.
> 
> 

HACKERMANS finishes typing, and sits back in their chair.


> That...still felt too easy. Haze is better than this. I wonder-
> 
> 

They shake their head.


> Nah, already got too much on my plate as is.
> 
> 

They type `#TY Haze <3` into their script and finalize.


> Alright, that's something. Will be good to get back into the field again. This NDA and house arrest have been a pain.
> 
> Back to the main problem now. You got anything to say buddy?
> 
> 

No response.


> Thought not. I could really use a hint, y'know? It's not like I've got much to work off of. Anything?
> 
> 

Still no response.


> Ra. I could use a rest.
> 
> 

Ecne tilts their head backward, over their seat back.

Blistering cold envelops the exposed skin, as if their head has been plunged into a blizzard.

HACKERMANS whips their head forward. Ice clings to their hair and nose.


> Ecne...what the fuck was that?
> 
> 

HACKERMANS sits in their chair, catching their breath. Then, gingerly, they close their eyes and lean backwards again.

The Cold again. HACKERMAN keeps their head held back.

*What do you want me to do here? How can I use this? C'mon Ecne, give me something. I feel you want to help me with this, I just need a lead. Just give me something I can bite into.*

HACKERMANS keeps their head back for two minutes thirty-seven seconds before pulling forward. He sighs.


> Dammit, I just need something. I just...
> 
> 

The screen of their terminal displays a text file. HACKERMANS blinks at it, then leans forward.


> The Signals Left Unsung interrogation logs? Why...and why Birdy?
> 
> 


> Went in...outside encounter...inside...tubes...me
> 
> 

HACKERMANS smiles


> I'll have to thank her for keeping the stream up. Anyway...the Balor...wait..."sucked into another worm-hole fuckinâ thing and I am back in"-
> 
> 

HACKERMANS leans forward


> "The Cold"
> 
> "here but not...everything that did not happen happens"...time dilation.
> 
> 

HACKERMANS opens an email.

Hey Birdy, ~~I was looking at your~~

*No way in hell that gets past the ship's crawlers. Or gets me a chat with Birdy. Hmm.*

Hey Birdy, I've been thinking about your teleporter charges, and I was wondering if I could experiment on them with you a bit. Have some ideas I'd like to try out. Could you meet me in a frequency-shielded munitions test room some time?

Thanks,

Ecne

*That should get me a chat without having to worry about being listened in on.*

HACKERMANS looks around the room as if checking for bystanders.


> Thanks Ecne. Let's hope this pans out.
> 
> ...that felt wrong. Eh, got other things to do.
> 
> 

Some time later, in shielded munitions test chamber #4


> E: Hiya Birdy! Thanks for meeting me. I've been going a bit crazy shut up on board for so long with something to blow up. You brought the charges?
> 
> 

Birdy saunters in cooly, her gait somewhat lopsided from carrying a large case covered in various warning stickers that are struggling to stay on.


> B: Hey buddy! Hope house arrest ainât too taxing but then again, I know best that its a pain.
> 
> 

She giggles, the tone slightly unhinged but nothing too odd for Birdy.


> B: You bet I brought you some fuckinâ charges. Beats me why they are cooping you up after that mission. Ainât like you did anything wrong, wellâ¦actually- never mind. Anyway. I've got a few different ones-
> 
> 

She lays the case on the ground and pops the catch


> B: Iâve got grounding charges, very fun, teleportation charges, if you get travel sick I would not recommend them, and I haveâ¦ You didnât ask me out here to talk about these did you?
> 
> 


> E: Well, I *do* have some ideas I want to test out, but uh...the frequency-shielding isn't for the charges.
> 
> Look, I don't want to be an asshole and dig into anything you're not comfortable with, so just hear me out for a bit. I've been doing some personal digging into NHPs, but I haven't really found anything too useful. Not a lot of documented cases of mental connections with NHPs. So I was kinda running out of options, and I asked Ecne for a lead. Just something or other. And I leaned my head back.
> 
> And it ended up somewhere else. Somewhere really cold.
> 
> Then...Ecne I think pulled up your interrogation logs, or maybe someone else I'm not sure on that point, but I saw you mention something like that.
> 
> Like I said, I don't want to pry into anything you're not comfortable discussing, so if you want you can just tell me to fuck off and that's fair. But I'm worried this might be time-sensitive. Mirrorsmoke is doing some snooping, and...
> 
> 

HACKERMANS flicks their right eye. It makes a small *tink*, like hitting a pane of glass.


> E: So if there's anything you'd like to tell me, I'd appreciate it.
> 
> 

Birdy visibly shifts and looks somewhat anxious. She checks her wrist, though no watch is there, and wipes her hands on the legs of her boilersuit.

Under her breath she mutters


> B: I ainât got no excusesâ¦damn it.
> 
> 

She checks her surroundings, remembering where they are and grabs Ecne by the arm, lowering her voice to a whisper and leaning in close.


> B: What you are describing, and those logs, all of that is about what I like to call The Cold. Those snowflakes clinging to your hair, the ice that creeps along and that shiver up your spineâ¦that weird feeling that seeps in. Itâs The Cold and I am sorry that it has found you. That may be my fault.
> 
> 

Birdy pauses again and sighs, rubbing her face and muttering again to herself though this time something inaudible.


> B: As for personal connections to NHPs and mental stuff, you might want to check out the Paternal Anomaly. I can give you access if you want. Just donât go about telling people about it. Mirrorsmoke donât exactly know the whole about Paâ¦ I trust you enough at this point and if the cat does get out the bag? You know I will give you hell for it. But as for your âColdââ¦ it was definitely me taking about it and your buddy Ecne has certainly pointed you in the correct direction. There is a reason I vanish from the universe every once and a while. Unfortunately, one of my âepisodesâ occurred only a few weeks prior to our last mission together which has since raised some suspicions.
> 
> 

Ecne takes a few seconds for the information to sink in.


> E: ...ok. Alright. I've really thrown myself into the deep end with this haven't I?
> 
> I'd appreciate looking at that log you mentioned. And I'll see what I can do about allaying Mirrorsmoke suspicions. Might be able to edit some files to cover some details up.
> 
> Thanks for all this. I'll do some poking around The Cold, see if I can figure some things out. Got a couple other people I want to ask some questions too.
> 
> And uh...we can both agree this didn't happen, right?
> 
> 


> B: If you want to know more I can certainly tell you more, but I agree that it is best if we donât talk about this outside ofâ¦here.
> 
> 

Birdy gestures to the testing chamber.


> B: You know, last I was in The Cold I was stuck in there for about two years, for you guys, it was only three days. I got my Balor from it thoughâ¦itâs the only reason I survived. I bumped into what I think was some H0RUS operatives trying to use it as a means of transport through space-time but they got stuck in that damned place and were pretty pissed about it.
> 
> 

Birdy pauses again, oddly calm and her demeanour much more focused than usual.


> B: From what I grasp, its more pocket dimension than parallel universe in the sense that time there is not quite the same as here. Yes, it has factors of our own universe, but its almost as if someone has taken everything that is and destroyed it and put everything that isnât there. A side effect of trying to warp the fabric of reality and bend it to your will to allow you to jump from one place to another in space. Unfortunately, I fucked about too close to the space-time continuum trying to perfect my silly little idea for a new type of warp core some many, many years ago. Probably longer ago than you have probably been aliveâ¦though I donât know. Or maybe it was the fact I was working in an underground organisation at the time and resources were less than decent. Who knows.
> 
> 

She shrugs and looks to the floor.


> B: At least I am not in this mess on my own anymore.
> 
> 

For a second a flicker of a smile crosses her face but it is strained.


> B: I have created a document on The Cold that covers everything from me prompting the first initial bridge some 230 years ago or so all the way up til now. I will get it to you if you want it. Mirrorsmoke has no clue of its existence.
> 
> 


> E: I'll take any info on The Cold I can get, thanks. Maybe we can both get some use out of this.
> 
> Anyway, we should probably do something with these charges, right? Would be a waste for you to have lugged them out here for nothing. Besides, I did have some ideas for them. Time hasn't seemed quite as linear as it used to, and I want to see if I can put that to work.
> 
> 


> B: Yes! I would agree. These charges should not be put to waste.
> 
> 

Birdyâs attention turns back to the case and she rubs her hands together excitedly.


> B: Now, would you like to find out what how non-linear time is by blowing up one of these?
> 
> 


> E: Don't mind if I do.
> 
>

*Sometime within the 24 hours following the Budding Problems mission*

Ecne sat at their console. So much work to do.


> Alright. Well, start with the fun stuff.
> 
> 

HACKERMANS pulls up a file on Alaren.


> Let's see what dirt I can find on those real estate investor asshats.
> 
> 

As HACKERMANS works, he thinks back on the Budding Problems mission. The resource shipments he didn't remember making. The strange creatures on Alaren. The paracausal crystal, and the instinctual detestation and dread that accompanied its disappearance.

HACKERMANS sighs.


> I'm gonna have to have a word with Mercury.
> 
> 

Mercury had been growing more active recently, a fact which was concerning in and of itself. Combine that with Ecne's feelings toward the crystal, and it became clear the Mercury was up to *something* on a large scale. Something that would need to be looked into.

Then again, it wasn't like Mercury could talk. And unstable NHPs are dangerous, even for someone like Ecne. Maybe even especially for Ecne. They were going to need everything they could going into this.

HACKERMANS took a break from attempting to ruin investors' lives to pull up the roster of people who had been on the Budding Problems expedition. Most of the people who had gone were chill enough, but not exactly the kind of person Ecne wanted. There was one though.

*In lancer living quarters.*


> E: Hiya Honey! How're you holding up?
> 
> 

Honey was leaning over her terminal, and quickly turned at the sound of Ecne's voice.


> HB: Hey HACKERMANS! I assume you have questions for me?
> 
> E: Yeah, was wondering what you thought of the whole Budding Problems incident. I could use an outside perspective on the business.
> 
> 


> HB: It was interesting, to say the least. Non-tangible objects randomly spawning creatures isnât something we see every day.
> 
> 

Honey had noticed Ecneâs eye, in the flickers between his hologram, just as she knows that he has noticed herâ¦ condition. Why else would he be here?


> E: Yeah, that's fair. Any thoughts on the shipment origin?
> 
> 


> HB: What, that they apparently originated from you?
> 
> 


> E: ...yeah.
> 
> 

HACKERMANS is carefully watching Honey's expression. He knows he's getting into potentially dangerous territory given his changing state and Mercury's...everything.


> E: Frankly, I was kinda wondering what you make of that whole deal.
> 
> 

Honey looked around at the room. She placed a hand on a control panel, and after a moment, a ker-chunk sound was heard as the lights went off. Without the buzzing of the various electronics, the room was rather quiet.


> HB: Privacy.
> 
> 

Ecne's right eye remains one of the few sources of illumination in the room.


> E: I was going to recommend the same. May I?
> 
> 

He gestures towards a chair.

Honey nodded, pulling up a seat herself.


> HB: Yes, of course.
> 
> 

Despite the faraday cage she had essentially created for the two of them, she still chose her words carefully.


> HB: You need to be careful, Ecne. Things like that, if found out, will get you hurt, or locked up, or... well... you won't be able to think like yourself anymore.
> 
>   
> HB: But, this is a part of you now. My advice is to choose who you want to be. Keep *yourself* in check. To keep it simple: donât you dare let yourself cascade.
> 
> 


> E: ...
> 
> E: Going to be honest, that was a lot more than I expected.
> 
> 

Ecne sits in their seat for a bit, staring up at the ceiling, contemplating.


> E: I'll...work on it. I think I can deal with Mirrorsmoke, at least for the time being. Haze seems fine. The rest...
> 
> E: I'm going to have to get moving. Mercury's working on something. Ecne's not happy about it. I'm already not myself, and it's getting worse.
> 
> E: I'm going to try to talk with Mercury. After that, I think Mirrorsmoke is going to do another mission with the intel they got from Budding Problems. I'll see what happens there.
> 
> 

Ecne sits for a moment, then gets up and heads for the door.


> E: Thanks for that. I'll keep it in mind. And Honey?
> 
> 


> HB: Yes?
> 
> 


> E: Keep a backup of me in your memory banks, will you? I may need it.
> 
>
