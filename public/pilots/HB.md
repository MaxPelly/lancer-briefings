[The screen displays ‚ÄúStream Starting Soon‚Äù on a cream background with pale yellow honeycomb designs scattered about. After roughly a minute, the stream changes to a view of the horizon an unidentified planet. Honey‚Äôs Virtual Humanoid Model (henceforth referred to as a VHM) is present in the bottom left-hand corner. A display of the viewer chat is visible on the right-hand side.]

Honey: Stream up? Can you guys see me?

Honey: Lovely, let‚Äôs get started then. Hi Honeycombs! Welcome to the stream, we‚Äôre off to go complete another mission!

[The stream view turns around, and an active battleground is visible. Gunshots and explosions can be heard in the background.]

Honey: As usual, today‚Äôs stream is sponsored by Smith-Shimano Corporation! Smith-Shimano is the leading edge in mech development, specializing in mechs designed specifically to you.

???: Honey, your mic is on.

Honey: I know. You aren‚Äôt exempt from the ad reads <3.

Honey: Hmm?

???: That... sound?

Honey: Do you mean <3?

???: Yea...

Honey: Don‚Äôt worry about it üòä

[The stream proceeds, Honey chattering on with her chat and allies as the battle continues.]
