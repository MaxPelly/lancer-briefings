From the Purview world of Arkady II, in the Dawnline shore, and proud of the fact.  
The descendent of two HA AMT members who helped convert the world from the Baronies in the previous century and are now retired as Able Citizens.   
Initially rejected from AMT screening due to personality mismatch, and joined up with Mirrorsmoke to get necessary experience (and Manna) while piloting a surplus GMS Everest from the 2nd Interest War.
